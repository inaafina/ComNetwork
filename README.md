# ComNetwork
Final Project for Computer Network Course

In this file, we made a simple web server Program based on TCP Socket programming. 

We have 6 goal for this web server:
1. Implementation of a TCP socket and linking it to a specific address and port
2. Web server programs can receive and parse the sent HTTP requests by the browser
3. Web server can search for and retrieve files (from the file system) requested by clients
4. Web servers can create an HTTP response message consisting of headers and requested file content
5. Web server can send a response message that has been made to the browser (client) and can display properly on the client side
6. If the file requested by the client is not available, the web server can send a message “404 Not Found” and can be displayed correctly on the client side.

How to run this web server?
1. Run Server on CMD
2. Run Client on separate CMD
3. Go to browser and run localhost:8080/test.html
